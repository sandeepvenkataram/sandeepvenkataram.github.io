Hi! I am currently one of the two computational biologists / data scientists at Hexagon Bio, a relatively small biotech company developing novel antibody drug conjugate (ADC) payloads for cancer. As a small startup, I am involved in multiple types of projects

1. Data analysis and developing machine learning models from both public and private data
2. Developing tools to visualize data
3. Software development to support laboratory operations

Nearly all of these projects involve extensive collaboration in a cross-functional environment, including laboratory personnel, other computational biologists, software engineers, and senior leadership. In the two years I have been at Hexagon, I have made key contributions to a number of projects

1. Developing a custom analysis pipeline to support 1000+ chemical-genetic screens / week
2. Generating a phylogenetic tree from > 70,000 fungal genomes
3. Training classifiers on compounds to predict various chemical and biological properties
4. Developing visualization tools to support both early discovery and late discovery efforts. These tools are currently used to generate figures for both internal and external meetings and have > 3000 page views per month (in a 40-person company).
5. Identifying potential liabilities for clinical trials in molecules of interest by leveraging public datasets

Please see my full [CV](cv) for additional information.

I also have extensive wet-lab experience through my previous career as an academic scientist. My research focus was on quantifying the repeatability of evolution in model microbial systems. Through my PhD (at Stanford, advised by Prof. Dmitri Petrov) and post-doctoral training (at UCSD, advised by Prof. Sergey Kryazhimskiy), I designed and conducted wet-lab experiments to engineer microbial systems, track their evolution, and sequence their genomes. I then developed data analysis pipelines to quantify the repeatability of evolution at various levels of genome organization. These efforts resulted in first-author publications in Cell, Nature Ecology and Evolution, Current Biology, and PNAS. Please see the [publications page](publications) for a full bibliography and PDF downloads of the manuscripts.
